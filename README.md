# NTFS Streams [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ou84yb1e4b4xoty7)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Walkman100/ntfs-streams)

A library for working with alternate data streams on NTFS file systems from .NET applications.

This branch is a Submodule-able repo for the library, converted to VB.Net so I can include it directly in my projects.

The original project is in the master branch, and is part of this article: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/ntfsstreams.aspx
